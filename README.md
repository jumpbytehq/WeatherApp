# Dribbble-to-App Series
To satisfy our code bug, we decided to run a small series of app development, where we take some good designs from Dribbble and develop them into real apps. This is the 1st app in the series.

Disclaimer: The exercise is just for fun and the design credit goes to Dribbble user.
